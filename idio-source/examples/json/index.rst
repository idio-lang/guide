JSON
####

The :ref:`JSON5 module <ref:json5 module>` allows you to load JSON_ or
JSON5_ from a file, handle or string which will be returned as an
appropriate value (commonly a :ref:`hash table <ref:hash table
type>`).

Remember, JSON(5) is a machine data interchange format and there isn't
a native reader form in :lname:`Idio`.
